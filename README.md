This repository contains all of the code used to characterize and quantify the degree of structural disorder in the amorphous monolayer carbon (AMC) structures discussed in the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18041.

The file `structures/` also contains all of the structures (stored as XYZ files) used in the paper. 
Some of the scripts and modules in this repo import functions from the `qcnico` module, which can be found here: https://github.com/ngastellu/qcnico.
